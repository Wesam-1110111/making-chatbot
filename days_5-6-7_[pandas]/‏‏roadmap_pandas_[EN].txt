Day 1: Basics and Understanding Data
Objective: Understand the basics, create DataFrames, and explore data.
Introduction to Pandas:

Learn what Pandas is and what it offers for data manipulation.
Install the library: pip install pandas.
Read a brief introduction to Pandas from the official documentation or reliable learning resources.
Series and DataFrames:

Learn how to create Series and DataFrames.
Understand the difference between them and how to work with each.
Create DataFrames from Python dictionaries, lists, and simple CSV files.
Exploring Data:

Load data from CSV, Excel, or JSON files into a DataFrame.
Use functions like head(), tail(), info(), describe() to understand the structure of your data and get basic information.
Filter and index data using loc and iloc.
Practical Tasks:
Load a simple CSV file (e.g., employee data) and use the mentioned functions to explore the data.
Day 2: Data Manipulation and Analysis
Objective: Understand how to handle and manipulate data.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values using isnull(), dropna(), fillna().
Rename columns using rename().
Change data types using astype().
Handling Text Data:

Use string functions (str) to manipulate text data in columns.
Extract parts of texts, convert texts to uppercase/lowercase.
Merging and Joining Data:

Combine datasets using merge(), concat(), join().
Understand how to join tables using common keys.
Mathematical and Statistical Operations:

Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on DataFrames.
Calculate statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation using mean(), median(), std().
Practical Tasks:
Clean a dataset that contains missing values.
Merge two different tables containing related information (e.g., customers and orders).
Day 3: Advanced Analysis and Data Aggregation
Objective: Learn how to perform advanced analysis and data aggregation.
Grouping Data:

Learn how to use groupby() to group data.
Apply aggregation functions like sum(), count(), mean() to grouped data.
Understand how to summarize data for specific groups.
Transformation and Apply Functions:

Use apply() to apply custom functions to your data.
Use pivot_table() to create pivot tables for data analysis.
Time Series Data:

Work with time series data, convert dates to datetime format using pd.to_datetime().
Extract parts of dates (year, month, day).
Group data by time periods such as months or years.
Saving and Exporting Data:

Save modified data to CSV or Excel files using to_csv() and to_excel().
Practical Tasks:
Perform data analysis using groupby() to generate multiple statistics.
Create a pivot table to analyze data based on different criteria.
Load, process, and aggregate time series data based on a time period.
Additional Tips:
Try working on a small project that involves real-world data, such as analyzing sales data or weather data.
Look for challenges or data analysis competitions on platforms like Kaggle to apply what you've learned.
