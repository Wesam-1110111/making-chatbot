The os module in Python is a built-in library that provides a way to interact with the operating system. It allows you to perform various tasks such as file and directory manipulation, path handling, and executing system commands.

Here are some key functionalities provided by the os module:

1. File and Directory Management:
os.listdir(path): Lists all files and directories in the specified path.
os.remove(path): Deletes a specified file.
os.rmdir(path): Deletes an empty directory.
os.mkdir(path): Creates a new directory.
os.makedirs(path): Creates multiple directories along a specified path.
2. Path Handling:
os.path.join(*paths): Joins multiple path components into a single path in a way that's compatible with the operating system.
os.path.exists(path): Checks if a file or directory exists.
os.path.abspath(path): Returns the absolute path of a file or directory.
3. Executing System Commands:
os.system(command): Executes a system command as if you were typing it in the command line.
4. Environment and System Information:
os.getenv(key, default=None): Retrieves the value of an environment variable.
os.environ: Allows you to read or modify all environment variables.
os.getlogin(): Returns the name of the user currently logged in.
5. Process Management:
os.getpid(): Returns the process ID of the current process.
os.fork(): Creates a new process (available on Unix-based systems only).
os.kill(pid, signal): Sends a signal to a specified process.

Practical Example:

----
import os

# Create a new directory
os.mkdir("new_folder")

# List files and directories in the current path
print(os.listdir("."))

# Check if the directory exists
if os.path.exists("new_folder"):
    print("The folder exists.")

# Delete the directory
os.rmdir("new_folder")

----
In summary, the os module provides powerful tools to interact with the operating system directly from a Python script.
